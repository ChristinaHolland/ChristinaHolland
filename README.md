- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChristinaHolland
- 👀 I’m interested in math, science, and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about data science. Just completed the General Assembly Data Science Immersive course, and now I want to go learn more about YOLO, Computer Vision, and RoboFlow, and also noise/signal processing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to use data science to improve the world!
